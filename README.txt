----- Launching -----

To import the game library ('INPUT.txt'), drag the input file into GameStore.jar. The library 
must be in the main directory of the jar, or the program will not load properly.
*NOTE* The game library MUST be named 'INPUT.txt' (case-sensitive) for the program to run.

To launch the executable jar, open the command prompt and change the directory to where the 
jar file is saved on your device (e.g. If the jar is saved to the desktop, you would enter 
'cd  desktop'). Once the correct directory is accessed, enter 'java -jar GameStore.jar' 
in the command prompt and the program will launch.

----- Navigating ----- 
The program consists of the four tabs (found at the top of the window), the drop-down menu and
the checkbox (found at the bottom of the window). By default, the program displays the 
'All games' tab. Any of the tabs can be accessed by left clicking on them.  

To change the genre of games shown, left click the drop down menu to open it and 
select which genre of games you would like to have displayed. Changing the genre will filter
the displayed games on the 'All Games', 'New Releases', and 'Top Rated' tabs by the selected 
genre. Selecting the 'All' genre will show every game.

To filter the displayed games by multiplayer support, left click the checkbox named 'Show 
Multiplayer Games Only'. When this flag is activated, a checkmark will appear in the checkbox 
and the displayed games on the 'All Games', 'New Releases', and 'Top Rated' tabs will be 
filtered to show only those that have multiplayer capabilities. Unchecking the checkbox will
remove the multiplayer-only filter and again show all non-multiplayer games.

The 'All Games' tab displays all of the games of the selected category that are available in 
the store. The games are ordered alphabetically in this tab.

The 'New Releases' tab displays the three most recent games of the selected genre that are 
available in the store. The three games displayed are in reverse chronological order.

The 'Top Rated' tab displays the three highest rated games of the selected genre that are 
available in the store. The three games displayed are in the order of highest rated to lowest 
rated. Games with ratings of a zero will never show up in this category.

The 'User Manual' tab displays the User Manual, also known as 'README.txt'.
